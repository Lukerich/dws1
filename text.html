		<h1>The Giant Squid (genus: Architeuthis)</h1>
		<p>

<b>The Giant Squid</b> (<i>genus: Architeuthis</i>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species.<br> </p>Giant squid can grow to a <em>tremendous size</em> (see <cite>Deep-sea gigantism</cite>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (<em>second only to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid">Colossal squid</a> at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms</em>).</p> <p>The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (<i>more for females, less for males</i>), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft).</p> <strong>Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented</strong>.

On the 30<sup>th</sup> of September 2004, researchers from the <b>NMNS</b> (<i>Museum of Nature and Science</i>) of Tokyo, Japan and the <b>OWA</b> (<i>Ogasawara Whale Watching Association</i>) took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. <br>Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <acronym title="Museum of Nature and Science"><b>NMNS</b></acronym> and <acronym title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association"><b>OWA</b></acronym> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on the 4<sup>th</sup> of December 2006.</p>
