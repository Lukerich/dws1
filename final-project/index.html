						<h2>Saint Cloud</h2>
							<p>Saint Cloud (<em>/ˌseɪntˈklaʊd/</em>; abbreviated <strong>St. Cloud</strong>) is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest population center in the state's central region; the Mississippi River runs through it. Its population is 65,986, according to 2012 census estimates.<br> 
							St. Cloud is the county seat of Stearns County and was named after the city of Saint-Cloud, France (<em>in Île-de-France</em>, near <strong>Paris</strong>), which was named for the 6th-century French monk Clodoald.<br>
							Though mostly in Stearns County, St. Cloud also extends into Benton and Sherburne counties.<br> 
							It is the center of a small, contiguous urban area totaling over 114,000 residents, with Waite Park, Sauk Rapids, Sartell, St. Joseph, Rockville, and St. Augusta directly bordering the city, and Foley, Rice, Kimball, Clearwater, Clear Lake, and Cold Spring nearby.<br> 
							With 189,093 residents at the 2010 census, the St. Cloud metropolitan area is the fourth-largest in Minnesota, behind Minneapolis–St. Paul, Duluth–Superior, and Rochester.<br>
						    (<em>The population of Fargo-Moorhead is also larger than St. Cloud's, but most of that is in North Dakota, with only 58,999 residents in Minnesota.</em>)

						<h2>History</h2>
							<p>This area was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years.<br> Europeans encountered the Ottawa, <em>Ojibwe</em>, and <em>Winnebago</em> as they started to trade for furs with Native American peoples.</p>
							<p>Minnesota was organized as a territory in 1849. The St. Cloud area was opened up to settlers in 1851 after treaty negotiations with the Winnebago (<em>Ho-Chunk</em>) tribe in 1851 and 1852. 
							John Wilson, a Maine native with French Huguenot ancestry and an interest in Napoleon, named the settlement St. Cloud after Saint-Cloud, the Paris suburb where Napoleon had his favorite palace.
							St. Cloud was a waystation on the Middle and Woods branches of the Red River Trails used by <em>Métis</em> traders between the Canadian border at Pembina, North Dakota and St. Paul.<br> 
							The cart trains often consisted of hundreds of ox carts; the Métis would camp west of the city and cross the Mississippi in St. Cloud or just to the north in Sauk Rapids.<br> 
							They were bringing furs to trade for supplies to take back to their rural settlements.</p>
							<p>The City of St. Cloud was incorporated in 1856. It developed from three distinct settlements, known as Upper Town, Middle Town, and Lower Town, that were established by European-American settlers beginning in 1853.<br> 
							The remnants of the deep ravines that separated the three are still visible today.<br> 
							Middle Town was settled primarily by Catholic German immigrants and migrants from eastern states, who were recruited to the region by Father Francis Xavier Pierz, a Catholic priest.<br> He also ministered as a missionary to Native Americans.<br> 
							Lower Town was founded by settlers from the Northern Tier of New England and the mid-Atlantic states, including former residents of upstate New York.<br>
							Upper Town, or Arcadia, was plotted by General Sylvanus Lowry, a slaveholder and trader from Kentucky who brought slaves with him, although Minnesota was organized as a free territory.<br> 
							By the time he was elected as St. Cloud's first mayor in 1856, serving one year, Lowry was politically powerful in central Minnesota.<br> 
							Successful as an Indian trader, he controlled considerable land.</p>
							<p>Jane Grey Swisshelm, an abolitionist newspaper editor who had migrated from Pittsburgh, repeatedly attacked Lowry in print.<br> 
							At one point he organized a "Committee of Vigilance" that broke into Swisshelm's newspaper office and removed her press, throwing it into the Mississippi River.<br> 
							He started a rival paper, The Union,
							The US Supreme Court's 1857 decision in the Dred Scott case ruled against slaves being able to file freedom suits, as well as declaring the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, so the territory's prohibition against slavery was unenforceable.<br> 
							Nearly all Southerners left the St. Cloud area when the Civil War broke out, taking their slaves with them. Lowry died in the city in 1865.<br>
							Beginning in 1864 Stephen Miller served a two-year term as Minnesota governor, the only citizen of St. Cloud ever to hold the office. Miller was a "Pennsylvania German businessman", lawyer, writer, active abolitionist, and personal friend of Alexander Ramsey, the governor.<br> 
							He was on the state's Republican electoral ticket with Abraham Lincoln in 1860.</p>
							<p>Although he never attended college, as governor Miller supported higher education, including the state "Normal" schools for teacher training, one of which became St. Cloud State University.<br> 
							In his final legislative address as governor, Miller made a strong argument for a black suffrage amendment to the state constitution, but no bill was developed or passed by the legislature.</p>
							<p>Steamboats regularly docked at St. Cloud as part of the fur trade and other commerce, although river levels were not reliable. Granite quarries have operated in the area since the 1880s, giving St. Cloud its nickname, "The Granite City."<br>
							In 1917, Samuel Pandolfo started the Pan Motor Company in St. Cloud. Pandolfo claimed that St. Cloud would become the new Detroit for all the Pan-Cars produced. He was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to defraud investors.
